# Cardano Corner
**Where Cardano Projects can find events and venues to send merch to.**

## What's this?
Motivated by hosting Lisbon's Cardano Constitutional Workshop, 45B is setting up a supply meets demand space between:
- IRL **Cardano events** happening soon anywhere in the world
- **Cardano projects** that may want to send merch, flyers, stickers, posters to events/venues.

We named this _Cardano corner_ as it may also help establish some _Cardano corner_ pins on Google maps for coworks/venues/cafÃ©s that may want to promote having (at least) a box full of stickers and merch that visitors can pick and take from.

## Events
Events willing to receive and exhibit/share merch from Cardano projects.
