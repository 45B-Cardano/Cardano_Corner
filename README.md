# Cardano_Corner
**Where Cardano Projects find Cardano events and venues they can send march to.**

## What's this?
Motivated by hosting Lisbon's Cardano Constitutional Workshop, 45B is setting up a supply meets demand space between:
- IRL **Cardano events** happening soon anywhere in the world
- **Cardano projects** that may want to send merch/flyers to be available there.

We named this _Cardano corner_ as it may also help establish some _Cardano corner_ pins on Google maps for coworks/venues/cafÃ©s that may want to promote having (at least) a box full of stickers and merch that visitors can pick and take from.

## Events
Events willing to receive and exhibit/share merch from Cardano projects
